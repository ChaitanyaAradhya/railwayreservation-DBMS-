This Railway Reservation Management System is a web-based DBMS project developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, designed to simplify and digitize the process of searching trains, checking seat availability, and booking tickets. The system allows users to register, log in, view available trains, reserve seats, and check their booking history, while administrators can securely log in to add new trains, update schedules, manage user reservations, and maintain all train and passenger records in the database. Built on core DBMS concepts such as relational schema design, CRUD operations, and authentication, this project offers an efficient, user-friendly platform for handling railway reservation operations in a centralized and automated manner, making it suitable for academic submissions and practical learning.
